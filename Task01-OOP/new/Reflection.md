# Reflection

## What I Learned
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Inheritance with `extends`
- How to override methods
- Using `super()` in constructors

## What Was Hard
- Understanding abstract vs interface
- Calling `super()` correctly

## What I Improved
- Better code organization
- Understanding OOP better

## Main Idea
Inheritance = less repeated code.
