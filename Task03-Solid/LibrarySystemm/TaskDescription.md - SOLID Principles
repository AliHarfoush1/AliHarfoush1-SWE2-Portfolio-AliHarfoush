 # Task: Library Management System

 ## Overview
 Simple library system demonstrating all SOLID principles.

 ## System Features
 - Add/remove books
 - Borrow/return books
 - Different user types (Student, Teacher)
 - Multiple notification methods (Email, SMS)
 - Generate reports

 ## SOLID Principles Demonstrated

 ### S - Single Responsibility
 Each class has ONE job:
 - `Book` - stores book data
 - `Library` - manages books
 - `EmailNotifier` - sends emails only
 - `ReportGenerator` - creates reports only

 ### O - Open/Closed
 Can add new features without changing existing code:
 - Add new user types (Guest, Admin)
 - Add new notifiers (WhatsApp, Push)
 - Add new report formats (PDF, Excel)

 ### L - Liskov Substitution
 Any user type works the same way:
 - `User user = new Student()`
 - `User user = new Teacher()`
 - Both can borrow books

 ### I - Interface Segregation
 Small focused interfaces:
 - `Borrowable` - only borrow/return
 - `Notifiable` - only send message
 - `Reportable` - only generate report

 ### D - Dependency Inversion
 Classes depend on interfaces not concrete classes:
 - `Library` uses `Notifiable` not `EmailNotifier`
 - Can swap Email with SMS easily
