 # Reflection

 ## What I Learned

 **SOLID Principles in Practice:**
 - **S:** Each class should do ONE thing only
 - **O:** Add features without breaking old code
 - **L:** Child classes must work like parent
 - **I:** Small interfaces better than big ones
 - **D:** Use interfaces, not concrete classes

 **Key Insights:**
 - Interfaces make code flexible
 - Can swap implementations easily (Email → SMS)
 - Each principle solves a specific problem
 - SOLID makes code easier to maintain and extend

 ---

 ## What Was Challenging

 **Understanding Dependency Inversion:**
 - Confused about "depend on abstractions"
 - Realized it means use interfaces as parameters
 - Example: `Library(Notifiable n)` not `Library(EmailNotifier n)`

 **Applying All Principles Together:**
 - Hard to see how they work together
 - Each principle complements the others
 - Started to see the bigger picture

 **Deciding Responsibilities:**
 - When to split a class?
 - If it does more than one thing → split it
 - Example: Library shouldn't generate reports

 ## What I Improved from Previous Tasks

 **Task 1 (Vehicle System):**
 - Basic inheritance and interfaces
 - Simple class structure

 **Task 2 (Workshop System):**
 - Added design patterns
 - Better code organization

 **Task 3 (Library System):**
 - **Focused on SOLID principles**
 - **Clear separation of responsibilities**
 - **More interfaces for flexibility**
 - **Better dependency management**

 **Specific Improvements:**
 - Task 1: Used concrete classes everywhere
 - Task 3: Use interfaces for dependencies

 - Task 2: Some classes did multiple things
 - Task 3: Each class has single responsibility

 - Task 1&2: Hard to add new features
 - Task 3: Easy to extend (just add new class)

 ## Main Takeaway

 SOLID principles make code:
 - **Easier to understand** - clear responsibilities
 - **Easier to change** - modify one thing without breaking others
 - **Easier to extend** - add features without changing existing code
 - **Easier to test** - small focused classes

 The key is: **Think about design before coding.**
